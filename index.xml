You may be wondering why you cannot see. This is normal. Due to the limitations of $CURRENT_TECHNOLOGY, visuals and auditory information cannot be generated. To counteract this, Systemware(R) has created the Systemware Intelligent System Software, or SWISS, to assist you. It will automatically generate descriptions of where you are in your dreamscape.</description></item></channel></rss>
